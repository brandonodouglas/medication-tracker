# medication-tracker
This repo is for tracking people's medication so they can have an easy to understand access of what medication they are taking and so on and so fourth.
Im using chatGPT to make a time management plan, and I'm going to incrementally make the app more complex as I get used to the fundamentals, using frameworks: 
for example a log in system, more compolex backend, AI chatbot interaction, payment plans, extra features for ways medication is administered. I want
my website/webapp to be scalable and easy to read, ensuring people (old and young) can understand how their medication is affecting them, and information
of resources and other stuff. I plan to make forums etc to, to keep places such as the NHS accountable for how they are doing their job, requuirements, etc.
I need to look into making my time management plan more effective, for example scheduling in when I wake up, paperwork, debts, finances and all that sort of stuff too.
